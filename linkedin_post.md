I’m excited to share a project I’ve been working on: **The AI Job Seeking Portal**.

Finding daily wage work or hiring unskilled labor often relies on informal networks, which can be inefficient and unreliable. This platform aims to solve that by providing a streamlined, real-time connection between workers and administrators.

**Key Features:**
🌍 **Multi-language Support:** Integrated Tamil and English support to ensure accessibility for all users.
📊 **Admin Dashboard:** A central hub for managing job postings, verifying workers, and tracking assignments.
📱 **Real-time Notifications:** Automated SMS/OTP flow to keep everyone updated on the go.
📍 **Location Awareness:** Leveraging Geo-location for smarter job matching.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js (Serverless)
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
- **Security:** OTP-based verification & Session management

This project was a great journey in building scalable, user-centric applications. Check out the repository below to see the architecture and code!

### Pro-Tips for your LinkedIn Profile:

1. **Featured Section:** Add a link to your GitHub repository or a live demo URL. Upload the system architecture diagrams (Context DFD, ER Diagram) as media items.
2. **Projects Section:** Add "AI Job Seeking Portal" to your Projects. Detail your role as a Full Stack Developer and list the technologies used.
3. **Video Demo:** If possible, record a 30-second screen recording of you navigating the Admin Dashboard and the Worker registration flow. This gets much higher engagement than static text!
